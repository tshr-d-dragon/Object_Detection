# Object Detection 

### Object detection using:
1. [YOLOv3-320](https://github.com/tshr-d-dragon/Object_Detection/tree/main/YOLOv3) with MS COCO weights
2. [ssd_mobilenet_v2_fpnlite_320x320_coco17_tpu](https://github.com/tshr-d-dragon/Object_Detection/tree/main/ssd_mobilenet_v2_fpnlite_320x320_coco17_tpu) for face-mask detection with TFOD2.0  
3. [ssd_mobilenet_v2_fpnlite_640x640_coco17_tpu](https://github.com/tshr-d-dragon/Object_Detection/tree/main/ssd_mobilenet_v2_fpnlite_640x640_coco17_tpu) for pothole detection with TFOD2.0
4. [YOLOv7](https://github.com/tshr-d-dragon/Object_Detection/tree/main/YOLOv7) for Helipad detection
5. [YOLOv8](https://github.com/tshr-d-dragon/Object_Detection/tree/main/yolov8) for Fire detection
