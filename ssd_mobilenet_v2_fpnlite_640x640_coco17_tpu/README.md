# Object Detection using ssd_mobilenet_v2_fpnlite_640x640_coco17_tpu with TensorFlow Object Detection (TFOD) 2.0

In this project, with the help of pretrained weights of ssd_mobilenet_v2_fpnlite_640x640_coco17_tpu, we can detect potholes on the road. Pretrained weights and config files can be found at http://download.tensorflow.org/models/object_detection/tf2/20200711/ssd_mobilenet_v2_fpnlite_640x640_coco17_tpu-8.tar.gz
